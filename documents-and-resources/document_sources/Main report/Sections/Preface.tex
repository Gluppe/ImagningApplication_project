%% A brief presentation of the study program. The purpose of the project from an academic / educational view. What have you learned academically, and in relation to the objectives? Any thanksgivings
\section{Preface}
\subsection{The Study Program}
The study program is concentrated around software engineering. You learn how to make user friendly and secure software for the internet and mobile devices. You also learn about good work habits by using modeling, testing and high code quality.

It is a practical study program. The theoretical knowledge you learn is quickly utilized in practical problem solving. During the study you will cooperate with peers to develop large scale computer system.

\subsection{The purpose of the project}
The purpose of the project was to put theory into practice. During the course we learned about object oriented analysis, unified modeling language, agile development methodology, vision and requirement analysis, software architecture, and many other subjects. The project allowed us to learn more about those subjects by using them to build a software. We also learned how to share information and knowledge with team members and a client.
